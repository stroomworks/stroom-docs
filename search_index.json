It is scalable - just add more CPUs / servers for greater throughput. It is suitable for processing high volume data such as system logs, to provide valuable insights into IT performance and usage.\nStroom provides a number of powerful capabilities:\n\nData ingest. Receive and store large volumes of data such as native format logs. Ingested data is always available in its raw form.\nData transformation pipelines. Create sequences of XSL and text operations, in order to normalise or export data in any format. It is possible to enrich data using lookups and reference data.\nIntegrated transformation development. Easily add new data formats and debug the transformations if they don't work as expected.\nScalable Search. Create multiple indexes with different retention periods. These can be sharded across your cluster.\nStatistics. Record counts or values of items over time, providing answers to questions such as \"how many times has a specific machine provided data in the last hour/day/month?\"\nDashboards. Run queries against your indexes or statistics and view the results within custom visualisations.\n\nBenefits\nSystem event data can come from many kinds of technology, this makes it highly heterogeneous with many different formats in use. As technologies are invented, new event types and log formats must be understood and processed correctly. Technology changes so rapidly that the auditing team risks being left behind.\nStroom is designed to offer a way to mitigate this risk, and has matured into an application that scales well to billions of events a day - sufficient to ingest and process the system events generated by the IT of a large organisation.\nThe person who introduces a new log format is probably best placed to describe it. Stroom provides these experts with tools that make it easy to normalise data, essentially crowdsourcing the problem. An organisation can ask their employees to configure Stroom whenever they introduce a new technology, and have confidence that it will be able to be properly audited.\nArchitecture\nStroom is a Java web application that runs on Apache Tomcat, with Apache Lucene indexes over a compressed data store. It uses a MySQL RDBMS to persist application configuration and metadata. \nCurrently Stroom has only been tested with Google Chrome. For this reason some functionality may not work correctly in other browsers. Now that Stroom is an open source project, support for other browsers will be improved.\nThere are several optional components for different use cases:\n\nStroom Proxy - An application that receives and forwards data to Stroom.\nStroom Agent - An application that extracts data from sources. \nLogging Events XML Schema - A common language for describing audit events.\nContent Packs - Transformation packages for standard log formats (e.g. Windows, Linux) into Logging Events XML.\n\nScreenshots\nSome screenshots of the application can be seen here.\nState of the Project\nStroom has recently undergone a significant code refactor and change to its security model.

Stroom is a generic and powerful tool for ingesting and processing data: it's flexible because it's generic so if you do want to start processing data we would recommend you follow this tutorial otherwise you'll find yourself struggling.\nWe're going to do the following:\n\nGet and run Stroom\nDo some quick and easy but necessary config\nGet some data into Stroom\nSet up a pipeline\n\nAll the things we create here are available as a content pack, so if you just wanted to see it running you could get there quite easily.\n\nNote: The CSV data used in mock_stroom_data.csv (linked to above) is randomly generated and any association with any real world IP address or name is entirely coincidental.\n\nGetting and Running Stroom\nThere are several options to get Stroom running and by far the quickest and easiest is to use Docker. If you're new to Docker then you might want to follow their getting started guide first. Otherwise you can run this:\ndocker run --name stroom-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -e MYSQL_USER=stroomuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=stroompassword1 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=stroom -d mysql:5.6\n\n# Run the Stroom docker image\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 --link stroom-db -v ~/.stroom:/root/.stroom --name=stroom -e STROOM_JDBC_DRIVER_URL=\"jdbc:mysql://stroom-db/stroom?useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8\" -e STROOM_JDBC_DRIVER_USERNAME=\"stroomuser\" -e STROOM_JDBC_DRIVER_PASSWORD=\"stroompassword1\" gchq/stroom\n\nIf you're really interested here are your full options for running Stroom:\n\nRun using a Docker Hub image\nRun using a release\nFrom source you can:\nBuild and run from IntelliJ\nBuild and run using Docker\n\n\n\nBasic configuration\nEnable processing of data streams\nAutomatic processing isn't enabled by default: you might first want to check other settings (for example  nodes, properties, and volumes). So we need to enable Stream Processing. This is in Tools -> Jobs menu::\n\nNext we need to enable Stream Processor jobs:\n\nBelow the list of jobs is the properties pane. The Stream Processor's properties show the list of nodes. You should have one. You'll need to enable it by scrolling right:\n\nGetting data into Stroom\nCreate the feed\nIn real life you might configure Stroom to watch for new files in a directory. In this tutorial we'll be uploading data but the result will be the same: raw event data sitting on a feed.\nA lot of Stroom's functionality is available through right-click context menus. If you right-click  System in the tree you can create new things. Create a new folder and call it something like Stroom 101:\n\nRight-click again and create a feed. The name needs to be capitalised, e.g. CSV_IN.\n\n\nThis will open a new tab for the feed. We want to add some data to the feed so click on Data at the top of the tab. \n\n\nThen click the green up arrow () to get the file upload dialog.\n\nWe're going to be putting in unprocessed events, known in Stroom as raw events. That's the type of stream this feed will contain, so that's the Stream Type you need to select. \n\n\n\n\nDownload this file, then click choose file from the dialog, select the file, and then ok everything until you're back at the feed.\n\nThat's it, there's now data in Stroom. You should be able to see it in the data table (you might need to click the refresh (button):\n\nNow you can do all sorts of things with the data: transform it, visualise it, index it. It's Pipelines that allow all these things to happen.\nCreate a pipeline\nPipelines control how data is processed in Stroom. Typically you're going to want to do a lot of the same stuff for every pipeline, i.e. similar transformations, indexing, writing out data. You can actually create a template pipeline and inherit from it, tweaking what you need to for this or that feed. We're not doing that now because we want to show how to create one from scratch.\n\n\nCreate a pipeline by right-clicking our Stroom 101 folder. Call it something like CSV to XML pipeline.\nSelect Structure from the top of the new tab. This is the most important view for the pipeline because it shows what will actually happen on the pipeline.\nCheck Advanced Mode so that we can actually edit things.\n\n\nWe already have a Source element. Unlike most other pipeline elements this isn't something we need to configure. It's just there to show the starting point. Data gets into the pipeline via other means - we'll describe this in detail later.\nAdd a data splitter\nData splitters are powerful, and a lot we can say about them. Here we're just going to make a basic one.\nCreate a CSV splitter\nWe have CSV in the following form:\nid,guid,from_ip,to_ip,application\n1,10990cde-1084-4006-aaf3-7fe52b62ce06,159.161.108.105,217.151.32.69,Tres-Zap\n2,633aa1a8-04ff-442d-ad9a-03ce9166a63a,210.14.34.58,133.136.48.23,Sub-Ex\nTo process this we need to know if there's a header row, and what the delimiters are. This is a job for a Data Splitter. \nThe splitter is actually a type of Text Converter, so lets create one of those:\n\nCall it something like CSV splitter. In the new tab you need to tell the Text Converter that it'll be a Data Splitter:\n\nNow go to the Conversion tab. What you need to put in here is specific to the built-in Data Splitter functionality, so I'm just going to tell you what you're going to need:\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nYou can see that it uses the data-splitter-v3.0.1.xsd that we imported earlier. Save it by clicking the save icon ().\nSo we now have a configured, re-usable data splitter for CSV files that have headers. We need to add this to our pipeline as a filter, so head back to the pipeline's Structure section and add a DSParser, as below. Call it something like CSV splitter filter:\n\nNow we have a pipeline that looks like this:\n\nClick on the CSV splitter filter element and the pane below will show it's properties. We need to tell it to use our newly created CSV splitter. Double click the textConverter property and change Value to the actual CSV splitter:\n\nTest the csv splitter\nSo now we have CSV data in Stroom and a pipeline that is configured to process CSV data. We've done a fair few things so far and are we sure the pipeline is correctly configured? We can do some debugging and find out.\nIn Stroom you can step through you records and see what the output is at each stage. It's easy to start doing this. The first thing to do is to open your CSV_FEED feed, then click the big blue stepping button at the bottom right:\n\nYou'll be asked to select a pipeline:\n\nNow you get a view that's similar to your feed view, except it also shows the pipeline:\n\nIt also has stepping controls. Click the green step forward icon (). You should see something like this:\n\nGreat! If you don't see this then there's something wrong. Click on CSV splitter filter. You'll see the conversion code and hopefully some errors. Some issues might be: did you remember to import the data splitter schema into Stroom? Did you remember to confgure the Text Converter to be a Data Splitter? \nIf everything went fine then click the step forward button a few more times and you'll see the yellow selection move down as you process each row.\nWhat we actually want to see is the output from the Text Converter, so click on CSV splitter filter. You'll see the conversion code we entered earlier and below two panes, one containing the CSV and one containing the split-up text, in XML form:\n\nSo here we have some XML in a basic format we call the records format. You can see the schema for records in the XML schemas folder.\nAdd XSLT to transform records format XML into something else\nCreate the XSLT filter\nThis process is very similar to creating the CSV splitter: \n\nCreate the XSLT filter\nAdd it to the pipeline \nStep through to make sure it's doing what we expect\n\nCreate the XSLT filter, calling it something like XSLT:\n\nOn the new tab click on XSLT. This is another big text field but this one accepts XSLT. This one will be very basic and just takes the split up data and puts it into fields. The XSLT for this is below but if you'd like to tinker then go ahead.\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nMake sure you save it.\nGo back to the Structure section of the pipeline and add an XSLTFilter element. Call it something like XSLT filter. \n\nSelect the XSLT filter and configure it to use the actual XSLT you just created by double-clicking xslt in the properties:\n\nIn the dialog make sure the value is the XSLT filter. Save the pipeline.\nTest the XSLT filter\nWe're going to test this in the same way we tested the CSV splitter, by clicking the big blue button on the feed. Click the step forward button () a few times to make sure it's working then click on the XSLT element. This time you should see the XSLT filter there too, as well as the basic XML being transformed into more useful XML:\n\nFantastic! Data converted! Well done if you've got this far. Really, there are lots of steps and things that could go wrong and you've persevered. There's a few more things to get this pipeline ready for doing this task for real. We need to get this data to a destination.\nOutputting the transformed data\nCreate the XML writer\nWhat's an XML Writer and why do you need one? The XSLT filter doesn't actually write XML but instead just passes XML events from one filter to another. In order to write XML out you need an XML writer. You don't need to create one outside the pipeline (in the way you did with the CSV splitter and the XSLT filter). An XML writer is just added to the pipeline like this:\n\nThat's it, no other configuration necessary.\nCreate the destination\nWe need to do something with the serialised XML. We'll write it to a stream. To do this we create a stream appender:\n\nUnlike the Source element this element needs to be configured. We need to configure two things: the streamType and the destination feed. \nSetting the feed\nWe'll send the output to the CSV_FEED - all data associated with this feed will be in the same place. To do that we edit the feed property and set it to CSV_FEED:\n\nWe also need to edit the streamType property:We set the streamType to Events:\n\n\nThat's it! Our pipeline is configured! \nTest the destination\nWe can test the XML writer and the streamAppender using the same stepping feature. Make sure you've saved the pipeline and set a new stepping session running. If you click on the stream appender you'll see something like this:\n\nSet the pipeline running\nObviously you don't want to step through your data one by one. This all needs automation, and this is what Processors are for. The processor works in the background to take any unprocessed data from a feed and put it through a pipeline. So far everything on our EXAMPLE_IN feed is unprocessed. \nCreate a processor\nProcessors are created from the Processors section of the pipeline:\n\nClick the add button  and configure the huge dialog. You only need to set the incoming feed and the stream types:\n(\nNow you'll see a very wide table looking something like this:\n\nThis shows two things:\n\nThe processor for the pipeline\nThe filter that determines what data is passed to the processor\n\nIf you scroll all the way over to the right you'll see the Enabled checkbox:\n\nCheck enabled for the processor and the filter you've just created. This is it, everything we've done is about to start working on its own, just like it would in a real configuration.\nIf you keep refreshing this table it will show you the processing status which should change after a few seconds to show that the data you have uploaded is being or has been processed. Once this has happened you should be able to open the destination feed and see the output data (or errors if there were any).\n\nYou can see that there are the Raw Events and the processed Events. If you click on the Events then you can see all the XML that we've produced.\nTroubleshooting\nIf nothing happens you might need to enable stream processing. This was explained earlier.\n"},"install-guide/stroom-app-install.html":{"url":"install-guide/stroom-app-install.html","title":"Installing Stroom","keywords":"","body":"Stroom Install\nPrerequisites\n\nInstall file 'stroom-app-distribution-X-Y-Z-bin.zip'.

Among these are tasks that control pipeline processing, removing old files from the file system, checking the status of nodes and volumes etc. Each task executes at a different time depending on the purpose of the task. There are three ways that a task can be executed:\n\nScheduled tasks execute periodically according to a cron schedule. These include tasks such as cleaning the file system where Stroom only needs to perform this action once a day and can do so overnight.\nFrequency controlled tasks are executed every X seconds, minutes, hours etc. Most of the tasks that execute with a given frequency are status checking tasks that perform a short lived action fairly frequently.\nDistributed tasks are only applicable to stream processing with a pipeline. Distributed tasks are executed by a worker node as soon as a worker has available threads to execute a tasks and the task distributor has work available.\n\nA list of task types and their execution method can be seen by opening 'Monitoring/Jobs' from the main menu.\n TODO image\nExpanding each task type allows you to configure how a task behaves on each node:\n TODO image\nStream Task Retention\nHow frequently we try and delete completed stream tasks older than system property \n(stroom.streamTaskDeleteAge)\nProxy Aggregation\nIf you front Stroom with an Stroom proxy which is configured to 'store' rather\nthan 'store/forward', then this task when run will pick up all files in the proxy \nrepository dir, aggregate them by feed and bring them into Stroom.\n(It uses the system property stroom.proxyDir)\nFile System Clean\nWhen you delete a stream in Stroom it only marks the database entry for the stream as deleted.\nThis is so deletes are instant as far as the user is concerned as it could take a while to \ndelete data from the disk.

The code for the clients is in the stroom-clients repository (TODO link).\nUNIX (using curl)\nCurl is a standard unix tool to send data to or from a server. In the following examples -H is used to specify the header arguments required by Stroom, see Header Arguments.\nNotes:\n\nThe @ character must be used in front of the file being posted. If it is not then curl will post the file name instead of it's contents.\nThe --data-binary argument must always be used even for text formats, in order to prevent data corruption by curl stripping out newlines.\n\nExample HTTPS post without authentication:\ncurl -k --data-binary @file.dat \"https:///stroom/datafeed\"\n        -H \"Feed:EXAMPLE_FEED\"\n        -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\"\n        -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nIn the above example -k is required to stop curl from authenticating the server. The next example must be used to supply the necessary CA to authenticate the server if this is required.\nExample HTTPS With 1 way SSL authentication:\ncurl --cacert root_ca.crt --data-binary @file.dat \"https:///stroom/datafeed\"\n        -H \"Feed:EXAMPLE_FEED\"\n        -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\"\n        -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nThe above example verifies that the certificate presented by Stroom is signed by the CA. The CA is provided to curl using the '--cacert root_ca.crt' parameter.\nFor step by step instructions for creating, configuring and testing the PKI authentication, see the SSL Guide\nExample HTTPS With 2 way SSL authentication:\ncurl --cert example.pem --cacert root_ca.crt --data-binary @file.dat \"https:///stroom/datafeed\"\n        -H \"Feed:EXAMPLE_FEED\"\n        -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\"\n        -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nThe above example both verifies that the certificate presented by Stroom is signed by the CA and also provides a certificate to authenticate itself with Stroom. The data provider provides a certificate using the '--cert example.pem' parameter.\nIf your input file is not compressed you should compress it as follows:\ngzip -c uncompressedfile.dat | curl --cert example.pem --cacert root_ca.crt --data-binary @- \"https:///stroom/datafeed\"\n            -H \"Feed:EXAMPLE_FEED\"\n            -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\"\n            -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n            -H \"Compression:Gzip\"\n\nWhen delivering data from a RHEL4 host, an additional header argument must be added to specify the FQDN of the host:\n-H \"Hostname:host.being.audited\"\n\nThe hostname being sent as a header argument may be resolved upon execution using the command hostname -f.\nSSL Notes\nTo create a .pem format key simply append the private key and certifcate.\ncat .key >> .pem\ncat .crt >> .pem\n\nTo remove the pass phrase from a openssl private key use.\nopenssl rsa -in server.key -out server-clear.key\n\nThe send-logs.sh script assumes the period start and end times are embedded in the file name (e.g. log_2010-01-01T12:00:00.000Z_2010-01-02T12:00:00.000Z.log).  The certificates will need to be added to the script as above.\nWindows\nUsing wget\nThere is a version of wget for windows\n\nUse --post-file argument to supply the data\nUse --certificate and --certificate-type arguments to specify your client certificate\nUse --header argument to inform Stroom which feed and environment your data relates to\n\nUsing curl\nThere is a version of curl for Windows\nNote: We haven't tried using this so if anybody would like to have a go and provide documentation for this section please do.\nUsing VBScript\nextract-data.vbs uses wevtutil.exe to extract Security event information from the windows event log.  This script has been tested on Windows 2008.\nThis script is designed to run periodically (say every 10 minutes).  The first time the script is run it stores the current time in UTC format in the registry.  Subsequent calls then extract event information from the last run time to the new current time.  The events are stored in a zip file with the period dates embedded.\nThe script requires a working directory used as a buffer for the zip files.  This can be set at the start of the script otherwise it will default to the working directory.\nThe send-data.vbs script is designed to run periodically (say every 10 minutes). The script will scan for zip files and send them to Stroom.\nThe script details several parameters that require setting per environment. Among these are the working directory that the zip files are stored in, the feed name and the URL of Stroom.\nSSL\nTo send data over SSL (https) you must import a client certificate in p12 format into windows.To convert a certificate (.crt) and private key (.key) into a p12 format use the following command:\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -in .crt -inkey .key -out .p12 -name \"\"\n\nOnce in p12 format use the windows certificate wizard to import the public private key.\nThe send-data-tree.vbs script works through a directory for different feed types.  \nUsing Java\nThe stroom-java-client provides an example Java client that can:\n\nRead a zip, gzip or uncompressed an input file.\nPerform a HTTP post of data with zip, gzip or uncompressed compression.\nPass down arguments on the command line as HTTP request arguments.\nSupports HTTP and HTTPS with 1 or 2 way authentication.\n\n(N.B. arguments must be in lower case).\nTo use the example client first compile the Java code:\njavac DataFeedClient.java\n\nExample HTTP Post:\njava -classpath . DataFeedClient inputfile=datafeed url=http:///stroom/datafeed system=EXAMPLE-SYSTEM environment=DEV feed=EXAMPLE-FEED\n\nExample HTTPS With 1 way SSL authentication:\njava -classpath . -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=ca.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=capass DataFeedClient inputfile=datafeed url=https:///stroom/datafeed system=EXAMPLE-SYSTEM environment=DEV feed=EXAMPLE-FEED\n\nExample HTTPS With 2 way SSL authentication:\njava -classpath . -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=ca.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=capass -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=example.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword= DataFeedClient inputfile=datafeed url=https:///stroom/datafeed system=EXAMPLE-SYSTEM environment=DEV feed=EXAMPLE-FEED\n\nUsing C#\nThe StroomCSharpClient is a C# port of the Java client and behaves in the same way. Note that this is just an example, not a fully functional client.\n"},"user-guide/sending-data/java-keystores.html":{"url":"user-guide/sending-data/java-keystores.html","title":"SSL Java keystores","keywords":"","body":"Java Keystores\nThere are many times when you may wish to create a Java keystore from certificates and keys and vice versa.

The expression builder allows for complex boolean logic to be created across multiple index fields. The way in which different index fields may be queried depends on the type of data that the index field contains.\nDate Time Fields\nTime fields can be queried for times equal, greater than, greater than or equal, less than, less than or equal or between two times.\nTimes can be specified in two ways:\n\nAbsolute times\n\nRelative times\n\n\nAbsolute Times\nAn absolute time is specified in ISO 8601 date time format, e.g.  2016-01-23T12:34:11.844Z\nRelative Times\nIn addition to absolute times it is possible to specify times using expressions. Relative time expressions create a date time that is relative to the execution time of the query. Supported expressons are as follows:\n\nnow() - The current execution time of the query.\n\nsecond() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the nearest second.\n\nminute() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the nearest minute.\n\nhour() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the nearest hour.\n\nday() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the nearest day.\n\nweek() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the first day of the week (Monday).\n\nmonth() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the start of the current month.\n\nyear() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the start of the current year.\n\n\nAdding\\/Subtracting Durations\nWith relative times it is possible to add or subtract durations so that queries can be constructed to provide for example, the last week of data, the last hour of data etc.\nTo add\\/subtract a duration from a query term the duration is simply appended after the relative time, e.g.\nnow() + 2d\nMultiple durations can be combined in the expression, e.g.\nnow() + 2d - 10h\nnow() + 2w - 1d10h\nDurations consist of a number and duration unit. Supported duration units are:\n\ns - Seconds\n\nm - Minutes\n\nh - Hours\n\nd - Days\n\nw - Weeks\n\nM - Months\n\ny - Years\n\n\nUsing these durations a query to get the last weeks data could be as follows:\nbetween now() - 1w and now()\nOr midnight a week ago to midnight today:\nbetween day() - 1w and day()\nOr if you just wanted data for the week so far:\ngreater than week()\nOr all data for the previous year:\nbetween year() - 1y and year()\nOr this year so far:\ngreater than year()\n"},"user-guide/dashboards/dictionaries.html":{"url":"user-guide/dashboards/dictionaries.html","title":"Dictionaries","keywords":"","body":"Dictionaries\nCreating\nRight click on a folder in the explorer tree that you want to create a dictionary in.

This storage could be a CIFS, NFS or similar shared file system. It is recommended that access to this shared storage is protected so that only the application can access it. This could be achieved by placing the storage and application behind a firewall and by requiring appropriate authentication to the shared storage. It should be noted that NFS is unauthenticated so should be used with appropriate safeguards.\nMySQL\nAccounts\nIt is beyond the scope of this article to discuss this in detail but all MySQL accounts should be secured on initial install. Official guidance for doing this can be found here.\nCommunication\nCommunication between MySQL and the application should be secured. This can be achieved in one of the following ways:\n\nPlacing MySQL and the application behind a firewall\nSecuring communication through the use of iptables\nMaking MySQL and the application communicate over SSL (see here for instructions)\n\nThe above options are not mutually exclusive and may be combined to better secure communication.\nApplication\nNode to node communication\nIn a multi node Stroom deployment each node communicates with the master node. This can be configured securely in one of several ways:\n\nDirect communication to Tomcat on port 8080 - Secured by being behind a firewall or using iptables\nDirect communication to Tomcat on port 8443 - Secured using SSL and certificates\nRemoval of Tomcat connectors other than AJP and configuration of Apache to communicate on port 443 using SSL and certificates\n\nApplication to Stroom Proxy Communication\nThe application can be configured to share some information with Stroom Proxy so that Stroom Proxy can decide whether or not to accept data for certain feeds based on the existence of the feed or it's reject/accept status. The amount of information shared between the application and the proxy is minimal but could be used to discover what feeds are present within the system. Securing this communication is harder as both the application and the proxy will not typically reside behind the same firewall. Despite this communication can still be performed over SSL thus protecting this potential attack vector.\nServlets\nThere are several servlets in Stroom that are accessible by certain URLs. Considerations should be made about what URLs are made available via Apache and who can access them. The servlets, path and function are described below:\n\n\n\nServlet\nPath\nFunction\nRisk\n\n\n\n\nDataFeed\n/datafeed or /datafeed/*\nUsed to receive data\nPossible denial of service attack by posting too much data/noise\n\n\nRemoteFeedService\n/remoting/remotefeedservice.rpc\nUsed by proxy to ask application about feed status (described in previous section)\nPossible to systematically discover which feeds are available. Communication with this service should be secured over SSL dicussed above\n\n\nDynamicCSSServlet\n/stroom/dynamic.css\nServes dynamic CSS based on theme configuration\nLow risk as no important data is made available by this servlet\n\n\nDispatchService\n/stroom/dispatch.rpc\nService for UI and server communication\nAll backend services accessed by this umbrella service are secured appropriately by the application\n\n\nImportFileServlet\n/stroom/importfile.rpc\nUsed during configuration upload\nUsers must be authenticated and have appropriate permissions to import configuration\n\n\nScriptServlet\n/stroom/script\nServes user defined visualisation scripts to the UI\nThe visualisation script is considered to be part of the application just as the CSS so is not secured\n\n\nClusterCallService\n/clustercall.rpc\nUsed for node to node communication as dicussed above\nCommunication must be secured as discussed above\n\n\nExportConfig\n/export/*\nServlet used to export configuration data\nServlet access must be restricted with Apache to prevent configuration data being made available to unauthenticated users\n\n\nStatus\n/status\nShows the application status including volume usage\nNeeds to be secured so that only appropriate users can see the application status\n\n\nEcho\n/echo\nBlock GZIP data posted to the echo servlet is sent back uncompressed. This is a utility servlet for decompression of external data\nURL should be secured or not made available\n\n\nDebug\n/debug\nServlet for echoing HTTP header arguments including certificate details\nShould be secured in production environments\n\n\nSessionList\n/sessionList\nLists the logged in users\nNeeds to be secured so that only appropriate users can see who is logged in\n\n\nSessionResourceStore\n/resourcestore/*\nUsed to create, download and delete temporary files liked to a users session such as data for export\nThis is secured by using the users session and requiring authentication\n\n\n\nHDFS\nStroom comes with a filter that allows you to write data to HDFS. It should be noted that communication with HDFS is currently not secure when using this filter.\nContent\nIt may be possible for a user to write XSLT, Data Splitter or other content that may expose data that we do not wish to or to cause the application some harm. At present processing operations are not isolated processes and so it is easy to cripple processing performance with a badly written translation whether written accidentally or on purpose. To mitigate this risk it is recommended that users that are given permission to create XSLT, Data Splitter and Pipeline configurations are trusted to do so.\nVisualisations can be completely customised with javascript. The javascript that is added is executed in a clients browser potentially opening up the possibility of XSS attacks, an attack on the application to access data that a user shouldn't be able to access, an attack to destroy data or simply failure/incorrect operation of the user interface. To mitigate this risk all user defined javascript is executed within a separate browser IFrame. In addition all javascript should be examined before being added to a production system unless the author is trusted. This may necessitate the creation of a separate development and testing environment for user content.\n"},"datasplitter/1-0-introduction.html":{"url":"datasplitter/1-0-introduction.html","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nData Splitter was created to transform text into XML. The XML produced is basic but can be processed further with XSLT to form any desired XML output.\nData Splitter works by using regular expressions to match a region of content or tokenizers to split content. The whole match or match group can then be output or passed to other expressions to further divide the matched data.\nThe root  element controls the way content is read and buffered from the source. It then passes this content on to one or more child expressions that attempt to match the content. The child expressions attempt to match content one at a time in the order they are specified until one matches. The matching expression then passes the content that it has matched to other elements that either emit XML or apply other expressions to the content matched by the parent.\nThis process of content supply, match, (supply, match)*, emit is best illustrated in a simple CSV example.

Both the root element  and  elements are content providers.\nRoot element \nThe root element of a Data Splitter configuration is . It supplies content from the input source to one or more expressions defined within it. The way that content is buffered is controlled by the root element and the way that errors are handled as a result of child expressions not matching all of the content it supplies.\nAttributes\nThe following attributes can be added to the  root element:\n\nignoreErrors\nbufferSize\n\nignoreErrors\nData Splitter generates errors if not all of the content is matched by the regular expressions beneath the  or within  elements. The error messages are intended to aid the user in writing good Data Splitter configurations. The intent is to indicate when the input data is not being matched fully and therefore possibly skipping some important data. Despite this, in some cases it is laborious to have to write expressions to match all content. In these cases it is preferable to add this attribute to ignore these errors. However it is often better to write expressions that capture all of the supplied content and discard unwanted characters. This attribute also affects errors generated by the use of the minMatch attribute on  which is described later on.\nTake the following example input:\nName1,Name2,Name3\nvalue1,value2,value3 # a useless comment\nvalue1,value2,value3 # a useless comment\nThis could be matched with the following configuration:\n\n\n  \n…\n  \n  \n…\n  \n\n\nThe above configuration would only match up to a comment for each record line, e.g.\nName1,Name2,Name3\nvalue1,value2,value3 # a useless comment\nvalue1,value2,value3 # a useless comment\nThis may well be the desired functionality but if there was useful content within the comment it would be lost. Because of this Data Splitter warns you when expressions are failing to match all of the content presented so that you can make sure that you aren’t missing anything important. In the above example it is obvious that this is the required behaviour but in more complex cases you might be otherwise unaware that your expressions were losing data.\nTo maintain this assurance that you are handling all content it is usually best to write expressions to explicitly match all content even though you may do nothing with some matches, e.g.\n\n\n  \n…\n  \n  \n…\n  \n\n\nThe above example would match all of the content and would therefore not generate warnings. Sub-expressions of 'body' could use match group 1 and ignore the comment.\nHowever as previously stated it might often be difficult to write expressions that will just match content that is to be discarded. In these cases ignoreErrors can be used to suppress errors caused by unmatched content.\nbufferSize (Advanced)\nThis is an optional attribute used to tune the size of the character buffer used by Data Splitter. The default size is 20000 characters and should be fine for most translations. The minimum value that this can be set to is 20000 characters and the maximum is 1000000000. The only reason to specify this attribute is when individual records are bigger than 10000 characters which is rarely the case.\nGroup element \nGroups behave in a similar way to the root element in that they provide content for one or more inner expressions to deal with, e.g.\n\n  \n  ...\n  \n  ...\n\nAttributes\nAs the  element is a content provider it also includes the same 'ignoreErrors' attribute which behaves in the same way. The complete list of attributes for the  element is as follows:\n\nid\nvalue\nignoreErrors\nmatchOrder\nreverse\n\nid\nWhen Data Splitter reports errors it outputs an XPath to describe the part of the configuration that generated the error, e.g.\nDSParser [2:1] ERROR: Expressions failed to match all of the content provided by group: regex[0]/group[0]/regex[3]/group[1] : \nIt is often a little difficult to identify the configuration element that generated the error by looking at the path and the element description, particularly when multiple elements are the same, e.g. many  elements without attributes. To make identification easier you can add an 'id' attribute to any element in the configuration resulting in error descriptions as follows:\nDSParser [2:1] ERROR: Expressions failed to match all of the content provided by group: regex[0]/group[0]/regex[3]/group[1] : \nvalue\nThis attribute determines what content to present to child expressions. By default the entire content matched by a group’s parent expression is passed on by the group to child expressions. If required, content from a specific match group in the parent expression can be passed to child expressions using the value attribute, e.g. value=\"$1\". In addition to this content can be composed in the same way as it is for data names and values. see match references for a full description of match references.\nignoreErrors\nThis behaves in the same way as for the root element.\nmatchOrder\nThis is an optional attribute used to control how content is consumed by expression matches. Content can be consumed in sequence or in any order using matchOrder=\"sequence\" or matchOrder=\"any\". If the attribute is not specified, Data Splitter will default to matching in sequence.\nWhen matching in sequence, each match consumes some content and the content position is moved beyond the match ready for the subsequent match. However, in some cases the order of these constructs is not predictable, e.g. we may sometimes be presented with:\nValue1=1 Value2=2\n… or sometimes with:\nValue2=2 Value1=1\nUsing a sequential match order the following example would work to find both values in Value1=1 Value2=2\n\n  \n  ...\n  \n  ...\n\n… but this example would skip over Value2 and only find the value of Value1 if the input was Value2=2 Value1=1.\nTo be able to deal with content that contains these constructs in either order we need to change the match order to any.\nWhen matching in any order, each match removes the matched section from the content rather than moving the position past the match so that all remaining content can be matched by subsequent expressions. In the following example the first expression would match and remove Value1=1 from the supplied content and the second expression would be presented with Value2=2 which it could also match.\n\n  \n  ...\n  \n  ...\n\nIf the attribute is omitted by default the match order will be sequential. This is the default behaviour as tokens are most often in sequence and consuming content in this way is more efficient as content does not need to be copied by the parser to chop out sections as is required for matching in any order. It is only necessary to use this feature when fields that are identifiable with a specific match can occur in any order.\nreverse\nOccasionally it is desirable to reverse the content presented by a group to child expressions. This is because it is sometimes easier to form a pattern by matching content in reverse.\nTake the following example content of name, value pairs delimited by = but with no spaces between names, multiple spaces between values and only a space between subsequent pairs:\nipAddress=123.123.123.123 zones=Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3 location=loc1 A user=An end user serverName=bigserver\nWe could write a pattern that matches each name value pair by matching up to the start of the next name, e.g.\n\nThis would match the following:\nipAddress=123.123.123.123 zones=\nHere we are capturing the name and value for each pair in separate groups but the pattern has to also match the name from the next name value pair to find the end of the value. By default Data Splitter will move the content buffer to the end of the match ready for subsequent matches so the next name will not be available for matching.\nIn addition to matching too much content the above example also uses a reluctant qualifier .+?. Use of reluctant qualifiers almost always impacts performance so they are to be avoided if at all possible.\nA better way to match the example content is to match the input in reverse, reading characters from right to left.\nThe following example demonstrates this:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nUsing the reverse attribute on the parent group causes content to be supplied to all child expressions in reverse order. In the above example this allows the pattern to match values followed by names which enables us to cope with the fact that values have multiple spaces but names have no spaces.\nContent is only presented to child regular expressions in reverse. When referencing values from match groups the content is returned in the correct order, e.g. the above example would return:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reverse feature isn't needed very often but there are a few cases where it really helps produce the desired output without the complexity and performance overhead of a reluctant match.\nAn alternative to using the reverse attribute is to use the original reluctant expression example but tell Data Splitter to make the subsequent name available for the next match by not advancing the content beyond the end of the previous value. This is done by using the advance attribute on the . However, the reverse attribute represents a better way to solve this particular problem and allows a simpler and more efficient regular expression to be used.\n"},"datasplitter/2-2-expressions.html":{"url":"datasplitter/2-2-expressions.html","title":"Expressions","keywords":"","body":"Expressions\nExpressions match some data supplied by a parent content provider. The content matched by an expression depends on the type of expression and how it is configured.\nThe ,  and  elements are all expressions and match content as described below.\nThe  element\nThe  element directs Data Splitter to break up content using a specified character sequence as a delimiter. In addition to this it is possible to specify characters that are used to escape the delimiter as well as characters that contain or \"quote\" a value that may include the delimiter sequence but allow it to be ignored.\nAttributes\nThe  element has the following attributes:\n\nid\ndelimiter\nescape\ncontainerStart\ncontainerEnd\nmaxMatch\nminMatch\nonlyMatch\n\nid\nOptional attribute used to debug the location of expressions causing errors, see id.\ndelimiter\nA required attribute used to specify the character string that will be used as a delimiter to split the supplied content unless it is preceded by an escape character or within a container if specified. Several of the previous examples use this attribute.\nescape\nAn optional attribute used to specify a character sequence that is used to escape the delimiter. Many delimited text formats have an escape character that is used to tell any parser that the following delimiter should be ignored, e.g. often a character such as '\\' is used to escape the character that follows it so that it is not treated as a delimiter. When specified this escape sequence also applies to any container characters that may be specified.\ncontainerStart\nAn optional attribute used to specify a character sequence that will make this expression ignore the presence of delimiters until an end container is found. If the character is preceded by the specified escape sequence then this container sequence will be ignored and the expression will continue matching characters up to a delimiter.\nIf used containerEnd must also be specified. If the container characters are to be ignored from the match then match group 1 must be used instead of 0.\ncontainerEnd\nAn optional attribute used to specify a character sequence that will make this expression stop ignoring the presence of delimiters if it believes it is currently in a container. If the character is preceded by the specified escape sequence then this container sequence will be ignored and the expression will continue matching characters while ignoring the presence of any delimiter.\nIf used containerStart must also be specified. If the container characters are to be ignored from the match then match group 1 must be used instead of 0.\nmaxMatch\nAn optional attribute used to specify the maximum number of times this expression is allowed to match the supplied content. If you do not supply this attribute then the Data Splitter will keep matching the supplied content until it reaches the end. If specified Data Splitter will stop matching the supplied content when it has matched it the specified number of times.\nThis attribute is used in the 'CSV with header line' example to ensure that only the first line is treated as a header line.\nminMatch\nAn optional attribute used to specify the minimum number of times this expression should match the supplied content. If you do not supply this attribute then Data Splitter will not enforce that the expression matches the supplied content. If specified Data Splitter will generate an error if the expression does not match the supplied content at least as many times as specified.\nUnlike maxMatch, minMatch does not control the matching process but instead controls the production of error messages generated if the parser is not seeing the expected input.\nonlyMatch\nOptional attribute to use this expression only for specific instances of a match of the parent expression, e.g. on the 4th, 5th and 8th matches of the parent expression specified by '4,5,8'. This is used when this expression should only be used to subdivide content from certain parent matches.\nThe  element\nThe  element directs Data Splitter to match content using the specified regular expression pattern. In addition to this the same match control attributes that are available on the  element are also present as well as attributes to alter the way the pattern works.\nAttributes\nThe  element has the following attributes:\n\nid\npattern\ndotAll\ncaseInsensitive\nmaxMatch\nminMatch\nonlyMatch\nadvance\n\nid\nOptional attribute used to debug the location of expressions causing errors, see id.\npattern\nThis is a required attribute used to specify a regular expression to use to match on the supplied content. The pattern is used to match the content multiple times until the end of the content is reached while the maxMatch and onlyMatch conditions are satisfied.\ndotAll\nAn optional attribute used to specify if the use of '.' in the supplied pattern matches all characters including new lines. If 'true' '.' will match all characters including new lines, if 'false' it will only match up to a new line. If this attribute is not specified it defaults to 'false' and will only match up to a new line.\nThis attribute is used in many of the multiline examples above.\ncaseInsensitive\nAn optional attribute used to specify if the supplied pattern should match content in a case insensitive way. If 'true' the expression will match content in a case insensitive manner, if 'false' it will match the content in a case sensitive manner. If this attribute is not specified it defaults to 'false' and will match the content in a case sensitive manner.\nmaxMatch\nThis is used in the same way it is on the  element, see maxMatch.\nminMatch\nThis is used in the same way it is on the  element, see minMatch.\nonlyMatch\nThis is used in the same way it is on the  element, see onlyMatch.\nadvance\nAfter an expression has matched content in the buffer, the buffer start position is advanced so that it moves to the end of the entire match. This means that subsequent expressions operating on the content buffer will not see the previously matched content again. This is normally required behaviour, but in some cases some of the content from a match is still required for subsequent matches. Take the following example of name value pairs:\nname1=some value 1 name2=some value 2 name3=some value 3\nThe first name value pair could be matched with the following expression:\n\n\nThe above expression would match as follows:\nname1=some value 1 name2=some value 2 name3=some value 3\nIn this example we have had to do a reluctant match to extract the value in group 2 and not include the subsequent name. Because the reluctant match requires us to specify what we are reluctantly matching up to, we have had to include an expression after it that matches the next name.\nBy default the parser will move the character buffer to the end of the entire match so the next expression will be presented with the following:\nsome value 2 name3=some value 3\nTherefore name2 will have been lost from the content buffer and will not be available for matching.\nThis behaviour can be altered by telling the expression how far to advance the character buffer after matching. This is done with the advance attribute and is used to specify the match group whose end position should be treated as the point the content buffer should advance to, e.g.\n\n\nIn this example the content buffer will only advance to the end of match group 2 and subsequent expressions will be presented with the following content:\nname2=some value 2 name3=some value 3\nTherefore name2 will still be available in the content buffer.\nIt is likely that the advance feature will only be useful in cases where a reluctant match is performed. Reluctant matches are discouraged for performance reasons so this feature should rarely be used. A better way to tackle the above example would be to present the content in reverse, however this is only possible if the expression is within a group, i.e. is not a root expression. There may also be more complex cases where reversal is not an option and the use of a reluctant match is the only option.\nThe  element\nThe  element matches the entire content of the parent group and makes it available to child groups or  elements. The purpose of  is to act as a catch all expression to deal with content that is not handled by a more specific expression, e.g. to output some other unknown, unrecognised or unexpected data.\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nThe  element provides the same functionality as using .* as a pattern in a  element and where dotAll is set to true, e.g. . However it performs much faster as it doesn’t require pattern matching logic and is therefore always preferred.\nAttributes\nThe  element has the following attributes:\n\nid\n\nid\nOptional attribute used to debug the location of expressions causing errors, see id.\n"},"datasplitter/2-3-variables.html":{"url":"datasplitter/2-3-variables.html","title":"Variables","keywords":"","body":"Variables\nA variable is added to Data Splitter using the  element.

Each variable must have a unique id so that it can be referenced. References to variables have the form $VARIABLE_ID$, e.g.\n\n\nIdentification\nData Splitter validates the configuration on load and ensures that all element ids are unique and that referenced ids belong to a variable.\nA variable will only store data if it is referenced so variables that are not referenced will do nothing. In addition to this a variable will only store data for match groups that are referenced, e.g. if $heading$1 is the only reference to a variable with an id of ‘heading’ then only data for match group 1 will be stored for reference lookup.\nScopes\nVariables have two scopes which affect how data is retrieved when referenced:\n\nLocal scope\nRemote scope\n\nLocal Scope\nVariables are local to a reference if the reference exists as a descendant of the variables parent expression, e.g.\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn the above example, matches for the outermost  expression are stored in the variable with the id of line. The only reference to this variable is in a data element that is a descendant of the variables parent expression , i.e. it is nested within split/group/regex.\nBecause the variable is referenced locally only the most recent parent match is relevant, i.e. no retrieval of values by \niteration, iteration offset or fixed position is applicable. These features only apply to remote variables that store multiple values.\nRemote Scope\nThe CSV example with a heading is an example of a variable being referenced from a remote scope.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n    \n    \n\n      \n      \n\n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn the above example the parent expression of the variable is not the ancestor of the reference in the  element. This makes the  elements reference to the variable a remote one. In this situation the variable knows that it must store multiple values as the remote reference  may retrieve one of many values from the variable based on:\n\nThe match count of the parent expression.\nThe match count of the parent expression, plus or minus an offset.\nA fixed position in the variable store.\n\nRetrieval of value by iteration\nIn the above example the first line is taken then repeatedly matched by delimiting with commas. This results in multiple values being stored in the ‘heading’ variable. Once this is done subsequent lines are matched and then also repeatedly matched by delimiting with commas in the same way the heading is.\nEach time a line is matched the internal match count of all sub expressions, (e.g. the  expression that is delimited by comma) is reset to 0. Every time the sub  expression matches up to a comma delimiter the match count is incremented. Any references to remote variables will, by default, use the current match count as an index to retrieve one of the many values stored in the variable. This means that the  element in the above example will retrieve the corresponding heading for each value as the match count of the values will match the storage position of each heading.\nRetrieval of value by iteration offset\nIn some cases there may be a mismatch between the position where a value is stored in a variable and the match count applicable when remotely referencing the variable.\nTake the following input:\nBAD,Date,Time,IPAddress,HostName,User,EventType,Detail\n01/01/2010,00:00:00,192.168.1.100,SOMEHOST.SOMEWHERE.COM,user1,logon,\nIn the above example we can see that the first heading ‘BAD’ is not correct for the first value of every line. In this situation we could either adjust the way the heading line is parsed to ignore ‘BAD’ or just adjust the way the heading variable is referenced.\nTo make this adjustment the reference just needs to be told what offset to apply to the current match count to correctly retrieve the stored value. In the above example this would be done like this:\n\n\nThe above reference just uses the match count plus 1 to retrieve the stored value. Any integral offset plus or minus may be used, e.g. [+4] or [-10]. Offsets that result in a position that is outside of the storage range for the variable will not return a value.\nRetrieval of value by fixed position\nIn addition to retrieval by offset from the current match count, a stored value can be returned by a fixed position that has no relevance to the current match count.\nIn the following example the value retrieved from the ‘heading’ variable will always be ‘IPAddress’ as this is the fourth value stored in the ‘heading’ variable and the position index starts at 0.\n\n\n"},"datasplitter/3-3-use-of-fixed-strings.html":{"url":"datasplitter/3-3-use-of-fixed-strings.html","title":"Use of fixed strings","keywords":"","body":"Use of fixed strings\nAny  value or  name and value can use references to matched content, but in addition to this it is possible just to output a known string, e.g.\n\n\nThe above example would output somename as the  name attribute.

This also allows fixed strings to contain $ and + characters.\nAs single quotes are used for this purpose, a single quote needs to be escaped with another single quote if one is desired in a fixed string, e.g.\n‘this ‘’is quoted text’’’\nwill result in:\nthis ‘is quoted text’\n"},"proxy/install.html":{"url":"proxy/install.html","title":"Installing Stroom proxy","keywords":"","body":"Stroom Proxy Install\nPrerequisites\n\nLinux Server's with at least 4GB RAM\nInstall files stroom-proxy-X-Y-Z-distribution.zip, stroom-deploy-X-Y-Z-distribution.zip\nTemporarily allow port 9080 if not relying on Apache Forwarding (see below)\n\nProcessing User Setup\nSee Processing User Setup.\nInstalling Stroom Proxy\nAs the processing user unpack the stroom-proxy-X-Y-Z-distribution.zip installation files\nin the processing users home directory.\nunzip stroom-proxy-X-Y-Z-distribution.zip\n\nStroom Proxy can be setup as follows:\n\nforward - as an aggregation point to store and forwarding onto another Stroom or Stroom / Proxy\nstore - to front Stroom for data ingest\n\nStroom Proxy - forward\nIn forward mode you need to know the server address that data is being sent onto.\nRun the setup script to capture the basic settings required to run Stroom Proxy in forward mode.\n\n@@ NODE @@ - Each Stroom instance in the cluster needs a unique name, if this is a reinstall ensure you use the previous deployment.\nThis name needs match the name used in your worker.properties (e.g. 'node1' in the case 'node1.my.org') \n@@ PORT PREFIX @@ - By default Stroom Proxy will run on port 9080\n\n[stroomuser@node1 ~]$ ./stroom-proxy/bin/setup.sh forward\n\n[stroomuser@dev1 ~]$ ./stroom-proxy/bin/setup.sh forward\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\nParameters\n==========\n\n@@NODE@@           : Unique node name for install [node1                                                     ] : node1\n@@PORT_PREFIX@@    : HTTP prefix to use           [90                                                        ] : 90\n@@REPO_DIR@@       : Stroom Proxy Repository Dir     [/stroomdata/stroom-proxy                                        ] : /home/stroomuser/stroom-proxy-repo\n@@FORWARD_SERVER@@ : Server to forward data on to [hostname                                                  ] : audit.my.org\n@@JAVA_OPTS@@      : Optional tomcat JVM settings [\"-Xms512m -Xmx1g\"                                         ] :\n\n...\n\nStroom Proxy - store\nIn store mode you need to know the mysql details to validate incoming data with.\n[stroomuser@node1 ~]$ ./stroom-proxy-app/bin/setup.sh store\n\n...\n\n@@NODE@@           : Unique node name for install            [node                                                      ] :\n@@PORT_PREFIX@@    : HTTP prefix to use                      [90                                                        ] : 72\n@@REPO_DIR@@       : Stroom Proxy Repository Dir                [/stroomdata/stroom-proxy                                        ] : /home/stroomuser/stroom-proxy-repo-2\n@@JDBC_CLASSNAME@@ : JDBC class name                         [com.mysql.jdbc.Driver                                     ] :\n@@JDBC_URL@@       : JDBC URL (jdbc:mysql://[HOST]/[DBNAME]) [jdbc:mysql://localhost/stroom                                ] :\n@@DB_USERNAME@@    : Database username                       [                                                          ] : stroomuser\n@@DB_PASSWORD@@    : Database password                       [                                                          ] :\n@@JAVA_OPTS@@      : Optional tomcat JVM settings            [\"-Xms512m -Xmx1g\"                                         ] :\n\nInstall Check\nStart the installed instance:\n./stroom-deploy/start.sh\n\nInspect the logs: \ntail -f stroom-proxy-app/instance/logs/stroom.log\n\nStroom Proxy Properties\nThe following properties can be configured in the stroom.properties file.\nTODO - Could do with a column indicating which proxy mode these properties apply to, e.g. store/forward\n\n\n\nProperty Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nrepoDir\nOptional Repository DIR.

This is a guide for running Stroom in IntelliJ for the purposes of developing/debugging Stroom.\nPrerequisites\nIn order to build/run/debug Stroom you will need the following:\n\nJava 8 JDK\nGit\nMaven\nIntelliJ\nA MySQL database server v5.5 (either installed directly or inside a Docker container)\n\nClone and build event-logging\nStroom is dependant on the event-logging project as this is used internally for generating audit events for activity in Stroom. Until event-logging is released to a public Maven repository you must first clone and build event-logging.\ngit clone https:///scm/stroom/event-logging.git\ncd event-logging\nmvn clean install\n\nEnvironment variables\nStroom relies on the environment variable STROOM_TMP to tell it which directory to use for its temporary files.  In development this is also the location used by the stream store. In the absence of STROOM_TMP Stroom falls back on the Java system property java.io.tmpdir.\nYou are recommended to set STROOM_TMP in your .bashrc / .zshrc file by adding like the following:\nexport STROOM_TMP=/home/developer/tmp/stroom/\n\nDatabase setup\nStroom requires a MySQL database to run. You can either point stroom at a MySQL server or at a MySQL Docker container\nMySQL in a Docker container\nTo configure the stroom database in a MySQL Docker container see Running Stroom using Docker for how to set this up.\nHost based MySQL server\nWith an instance of MySQL server 5.5 running on your local machine do the following to create the stroom database:\n# log into your MySQL server using your root credentials\nmysql --user=root --password=myrootpassword\n\nThen run the following commands in the MySQL shell:\ndrop database stroom;\ncreate database stroom;\ngrant all privileges on stroom.* to stroomuser@localhost identified by 'stroompassword1';\nquit;\n\nLocal configuration file\nStroom comes with a default configuration file but it is wise to set up your own local file to allow you to run with your own environment specific settings.\nThe default property file can be found in \nstroom-config/src/main/resources/stroom.properties\nCreate the your local configuration file and directory:\nmkdir -p ~/.stroom/\ntouch stroom.conf\n\nAdd any properties from stroom.properties that you want different values for, e.g.\n#Uncomment this to enable browser's right click menu for development\n#stroom.ui.oncontextmenu=\n\n#Connect to MySQL in Docker\nstroom.jdbcDriverUrl=jdbc:mysql://172.17.0.2/stroom?useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8\nstroom.jdbcDriverUsername=myOtherUser\nstroom.jdbcDriverPassword=myOtherPassword\n\nVerify the Maven build\nBefore trying to run Stroom in an IDE it is worth performing a Maven build without all the tests to verify the code is in a sound state.\nStroom is dependant on the event-logging repo for its build. Utill event-logging has been added to maven central you need to clone and build this first. So in your chosen directory for git repositories do:\ngit clone git@github.com:gchq/event-loggin.git\ncd event-logging\nmvn clean install\n\nOnce event-logging has built successfully it will exist in you local maven repository so you can now build Stroom, skipping the tests.\nmvn -Pgwt-dev-chrome -Dskip.surefire.tests=true clean install -U\n\nSample Data\nSome of the tests are dependant on some sample data and content being present in the database.  This sample data/content is also useful for manually testing the application in development. The sample data/content is generated by a class called SetupSampleData.java. This class assumes that the database being used for Stroom is completely empty.\nFirst you need to create a run configuration for SetupSampleData.java\n\nClick Run -> Edit Configurations...\nClick the green + icon to add a new configuration\nSelect Application as the configuration type\nIn the Main Class field enter SetupSampleData\nIn the Use classpath of module field select stroom-integrationtest\nIf you have set the STROOM_TMP environment variable in your .bashrc / .zshrc then ignore this step.  In the Environment variables field click the ... icon and add STROOM_TMP = ~/tmp/stroom/ (or whatever directory you choose)\nClick the OK button\n\nNow run SetupSampleData \n\nClick Run -> Run...\nSelect SetupSampleData\n\nYou should now have a database populated with tables and data, providing you with some predefined feeds, data, translations, pipelines, dashboards, etc.\nRunning Stroom from the IDE\nThe user interface for Stroom is built using GWT (see GWT Project for more information or GWT specific documentation). As a result Stroom needs to be started up with GWT Dev Mode. Dev Mode handles the compilation of the Java user interface source into JavaScript and the source map that links client JavaScript back to Java source for client side debugging.\nStroom is run from the main method in Startup.java. Before running this you need to setup the run configuration:\n\nClick Run -> Edit Configurations...\nClick the green + icon to add a new configuration\nSelect Application as the configuration type\nIn the Main class field enter Startup\nIn the Programme arguments field enter \n-startupUrl stroom.jsp -logLevel INFO -war . -logdir . -gen . -extra . -workDir . stroom.app.AppSuperDevMode\n\nIn the Use classpath of module field select stroom-startup\n\nIf you have set the STROOM_TMP environment variable in your .bashrc / .zshrc then ignore this step.  In the Environment variables field click the ... icon and add STROOM_TMP = ~/tmp/stroom/ (or whatever directory you choose)\nClick the OK button\n\nNow run Startup \n\nClick Run -> Run...\nSelect Startup\n\nYou should eventually see the GWT Dev Mode window appear.\n\nInitially, some of the buttons shown above will not be visible as it is in the process of starting up. As soon as the Launch Default Browser button appears you are ready to open Stroom in a browser. You have two options:\n\nClick the Launch Default Browser button\nOpen your preferred browser and enter the URL http://127.0.0.1:8888\n\n\nNOTE: Stroom has been written with Google's Chrome browser in mind so has only been tested on Chrome. Behaviour in other browsers may vary. We would like to improve cross-browser support so please let us know about any browser incompatibilities that you find.\n\nIn the browser you will initially see the following:\n\nStarting Stroom\nInitialising context...\n\nOnce the context has been initialised you will see the Stroom blue background and a spinner while GWT compiles the front-end code. Once the code has been compiled you will be presented with the Stroom login page. Stroom in development mode uses simple username/password authentication. Enter the following credentials:\n\nUsername: admin\nPassword: admin\n\nRight click behaviour\nStroom overrides the defualt right click behaviour in the browser with its own context menu. For UI development it is often required to have access to the browser's context menu for example to inspect elements. To enable the browser's context menu you need to uncomment the following property in your stroom.conf file, e.g.\n#Uncomment this to enable browser's right click menu for development\nstroom.ui.oncontextmenu=\n\n"},"dev-guide/docker.html":{"url":"dev-guide/docker.html","title":"Running Stroom using Docker","keywords":"","body":"Running Stroom in a Docker Container\nThis is how to run Stroom in a Docker container (assuming you have already installed Docker).
